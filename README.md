# xor-ann
XOR, Fully-connected ANN, and Nonlinear Boundaries

This algorithm is using the XOR gate truth table as the training set for the 2-layer-3-neuron network. For Every 1/10 of the specified number of training steps, the RMS error is checked by applying the neural net to the training data. The trained neural network is then applied to 2000 test data points and the results are used to visualize the nonlinear boundaries.
